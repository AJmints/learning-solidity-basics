BRINGING SOL INTO VSCODE

Setting up ethers simple storage component:
-corepack enable
-added yarn
-yarn add solc
-yarn add solc@0.8.7-fixed (to install this globally and not just locally to this folder we would use "yarn global add solc@0.8.7-fixed")

To compile our contract with yarn, this is the command we must enter. Make sure the pragma is the same as the yarn version (or below the yarn version)
-$ yarn solcjs --bin --abi --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . -o . components/ethers-simple-storage/SimpleStorage.sol

Our output contains the abi and the bin from the code. We will need these files.

We can change how we aquire our bin and abi by writing adding a script to our package.json file. In our scripts section we added...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "compile": "yarn solcjs --bin --abi --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . -o . components/ethers-simple-storage/SimpleStorage.sol"
  },

  Now when we want to get the abi and the bin of our contract in that specific route, we just have to enter "yarn compile" in our terminal.

Dowloaded and installed ganache, however, this part of the video hasen't aged well as ganache is closing shop (90 days from 9/22/23). After we learn 
using the hardhat run time environment we will need to delete ganache since it won't be receiving anymore updates. 

When making a call to the eth blockchain, we can call many methods to get the information we want returned. View...

LETS START USING ETHERS

-yarn add ethers

We are using ethers v6 while the video is using v5, so some of the code is different.


LEARNING TO ENCRYPT PRIVATE information

We can reference our encyptKey.js file to see how we created our encryptedKey.json file. Now the only way we can unencrypt this file is if we have
the password when we run our deploy. 

We learned how to use env files and how to set up and make our own env variables through the terminal. We also learned how to clear our history
In bash:
$ history    // shows us our history in terminal 
$ history -c    // clears our history in terminal
