BRINGING SOL INTO VSCODE

Setting up ethers simple storage component:
-corepack enable
-added yarn
-yarn add solc
-yarn add solc@0.8.7-fixed (to install this globally and not just locally to this folder we would use "yarn global add solc@0.8.7-fixed")

To compile our contract with yarn, this is the command we must enter. Make sure the pragma is the same as the yarn version (or below the yarn version)
-$ yarn solcjs --bin --abi --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . -o . components/ethers-simple-storage/SimpleStorage.sol

Our output contains the abi and the bin from the code. We will need these files.

We can change how we aquire our bin and abi by writing adding a script to our package.json file. In our scripts section we added...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "compile": "yarn solcjs --bin --abi --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . -o . components/ethers-simple-storage/SimpleStorage.sol"
  },

  Now when we want to get the abi and the bin of our contract in that specific route, we just have to enter "yarn compile" in our terminal.
