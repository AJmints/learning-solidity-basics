NEW CONCEPTS
Transaction terminoligy

TRANSACTION - VALUE TRANSFER
Nonce: tx count for the account
Gas Price: price per unit of gas (in wei)
Gas Limit: 21000
To: address that the tx is ent to
Value: amount of wei to send
Data: Empty
v, r, s: components of a tx signature.

TRANSACTION - FUNCTION CALL
Nonce: tx count for the account
Gas Price: price per unit of gas (in wei)
Gas Limit: max gas that this tx can use
To: address that the tx is sent to
Value: amount of wei to send
Data: What to send to the To address
v, r, s: components of tx signature

Note: When defining your gas amount, there are a few metrics you 
can use. Wei, Gwei, Finney, and ether
When breaking down the value, you can view it as a measure of ether. If you have 
1 Ether, then you have 1000000000 Gwei, or you have 100000000000000000 Wei. 


3.2
PAYABLE

When you mark a function with the payable keyword, it makes the function readable

Smart contracts can hold funds just like how a wallet can hold funds. Every time a
contract is deployed, it gets a unique address just like how a wallet is a unique 
address. Both wallets and contracts can hold the native blockchain token, like Ethereum.
