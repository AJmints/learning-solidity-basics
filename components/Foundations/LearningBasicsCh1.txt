In this Foundations folder, we are covering the very fundamentals of Solidity.

All the contracts we have written in the solidity-basics-ch1 folder are all deployable
and would all work on a testnet if deployed. 


CHAPTER 1

While following along with the video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ
we learned about the direct-injection option that exist in the Remix - EthereumIDE. 
We also got a glimps into the api's we would have to call if not deploying through that
IDE. We will be covering other ways of deploying to the Ethereum Virtual Machine in 
later lessons. 

We will also be learning about other EVM compatible blockchains, like Avalanche, Fantom,
Polygon, and more. These other blockchains are EVM compatible, meaning they can read 
the Solidity language.
