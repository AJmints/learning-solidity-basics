We can deploy contracts from other contracts, and we can interact with those
deployed contracts. Having contracts interacting with each other is an essential 
comoponent of Solidity. This concept of contracts seemlessly interacting with each
other is called Composability. Smart contracts are composable because they 
can easily interact with each other.

Composability is how seemlessly a contract and interact with another contract.

Composability is essential with DeFi, since our contracts can interact with these complex 
financial products. All their code is available onchain, so that is what makes it 
possible to interact with various DeFi products.
