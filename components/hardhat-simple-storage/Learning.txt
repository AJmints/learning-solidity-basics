When setting up our hardhat environment, we need to first install into the directory...
yarn add --dev hardhat || npm install --save-dev hardhat

Then to create our project we have to enter...
yarn hardhat || npx hardhat

Also will need 
npm i @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

And for TypeScript support 
yarn add --dev ts-node typescript || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
yarn add --dev chai @types/node @types/mocha @types/chai || npm install --save-dev chai @types/node @types/mocha @types/chai


NOTE: From the default files created, in the test folder, one method is broken, not sure why
Line 81:
    await expect(lock.connect(otherAccount).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
    "You aren't the owner"
    );

Also - these were missing from devDependencies:
"@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle": "2.0.6",
"@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers": "2.2.3",
"ethers": "6.7.1",

Also - for npx hardhat accounts, we have to add this code in our hardhat.config file.
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});
